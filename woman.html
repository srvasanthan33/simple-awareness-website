		<h1 class="head1">What Does It Mean to Be a Woman? It's<br> Complicated</h1>
		<p><b>I</b>n “adult human female,” according to a seemingly common-sense slogan seen on the T-shirts and laptop stickers of those who oppose the idea that transgender women are women. They argue that gender itself is a false ideology masking the truth of biological sex difference. But “woman” is complicated in ways that have little to do with transgender issues. Only the delusional would deny biological differences between people, but only the uninformed can maintain that what the body means, and how it relates to social category, doesn’t vary between cultures and over time.</p>

		<p>The “What is a woman?” question can stretch the bounds and bonds of womanhood in messy yet vital directions—as in the case of Marsha P. Johnson, a feminine gender-nonconforming person who graced the streets of New York City as a self-proclaimed “street transvestite action revolutionary” for decades. She’s now hailed as a transgender icon, but Johnson fits awkwardly with contemporary ideas of trans womanhood, let alone womanhood more generally. She called herself “gay” at a time when the word transgender was not common, and lived as a man from time to time. She used she/her pronouns but thought of herself as a “queen,” not as a “woman,” or even a “transsexual.”</p>

		<p>While some people now embrace a rainbow of possibilities between the familiar pink and blue, others hew even tighter to a biological fundamentalism. Those willing to recognize new forms of gender feel anxious about misgendering others, while those who claim superior access to the truth are prepared to impose that truth upon those who disagree. What’s right—even what’s real—in such circumstances is not always self-evident. Labeling others contrary to how they have labeled themselves is an ethically loaded act, but “woman” remains a useful shorthand for the entanglement of femininity and social status regardless of biology—not as an identity, but as the name for an imagined community that honors the female, enacts the feminine and exceeds the limitations of a sexist society.</p>

	<h5><i>Gender-based violence, already a global crisis before the pandemic, has intensified since the outbreak of COVID-19. Lockdowns and other mobility restrictions have left many women trapped with their abusers, isolated from social contact and support networks. Increased economic precarity has further limited many women’s ability to leave abusive situations. COVID-driven economic and social instability will also heighten the risk of child marriage, female genital mutilation and human trafficking. At the same time, the pandemic has exposed women leaders to backlash, leading to threats, abuse and harassment both online and offline. Violence against women leaders can prevent them from carrying out their duties regardless of the position they hold.</i></h5>

	<p>
		<ul class="list1">
			<li>Increase resources for shelters, hotlines and other services so that they can meet heightened demand.</li>
			<li>Protect elected and non-elected women leaders from gender-based violence. Any efforts to protect and combat violence against women in politics must consider women in all their public roles, including women civil servants and experts.</li>
			<li>Make information and communication channels accessible for women with disabilities.
			Scale up public awareness campaigns, particularly those targeted at men and boys.</li>
			<li>Increase funding to women’s organizations. Evidence shows that the strength of women’s organizations is one of the biggest factors in driving positive EVAW policy changes.</li>

		<h1>Simple, Effective Ways to<br> Take Back Feminism</h1>
		<h4>(Adapted from.Ellevatenetwork.com)</h4>

		<p>Feminism. As powerful as this buzzword sounds, many people who are gravely unaware of its actual connotations have attached a stigma to it and belittled it. Before delving into the topic any further, I will take a few moments to dispel any myths and common misconceptions associated with this word. Here is the literal definition of this new f-word;</p>

		<p><b>Make use of social/print and electronic media.</b>Highlight the issue in hand and help people understand it better by writing blogs, sharing articles, or perhaps by doing live videos with meaningful messages; even tweeting hashtags of popular movements that support the theme is a perfectly acceptable way to show your support.</p>

		<p><b>Call out inequality.</b>Even small acts of resistance can make a difference. According to Samantha Rennie, Executive Director at Rosa; “People must be held accountable for their thoughts and their actions, so when you see acts of sexism, racism, xenophobia, ableism, Islamophobia or anything else, call it out!" Sometimes people do not realize what’s wrong until someone points it out, so don’t hesitate to point out and raise awareness in suitable ways.</p>

		<p><b>Support non-profit organizations working for women.</b>Many women have fought to give us what we today enjoy as basic rights. Women are more empowered, confident and bold than they ever were and this didn’t happen overnight; there have been people responsible for getting us here. However, in many parts of the world, women are still being abused, traded, mutilated and deprived of education. Also, being part of an organized support gives you a proper platform not only for championing your support but also connecting with like-minded individuals.</p>
